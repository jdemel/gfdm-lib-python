# gfdm-lib-python
Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) library for python. This package provides basic functionalities for the implementation of GFDM with Python. It is tested in Python 2.7 and requires Numpy and Scipy extensions.

## Getting started
* Check [`./gfdm/detail/test`](https://github.com/vodafone-chair/gfdm-lib-python/tree/master/gfdm/detail/test) for getting some ideas on how to use the GFDM library.
* Use `from gfdm.detail.mllike import *` to make functions like `do_modulate`, `do_map` etc. available in the global namespace.

## Contact
